Exports your public blogroll in OPML format to a file on blog root.

== Description ==

When you have a big blogroll and wan't to make it public this comes handy. It will export your visible blogroll links into a valid OPML file on blog root and then you just have to create a link to it in your theme.

== Installation ==

How to install the Export OPML and get it working in two easy steps:

1. Upload `/export-opml/` folder and its files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or just use the Wordpress admin interface
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. In Settings just click in Export OPML. 
4. Create a link to it.
5. Repeat step 3 everytime you add or remove a visible link in your blogroll.
